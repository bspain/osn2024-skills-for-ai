Presented at [Open Source North 2024](https://www.opensourcenorth.com/schedule-2024/)

By: Benjamin Spain

## Skill #1 : Create Design Docs

- Abstract
- Changes
  - User Experience
  - API Behavior
  - Storage, Compute, or Network Data Transfer
- Review with engineering prior to development

- What success looks like:
  - Technical challenges are brought up and addressed before coding begins

- Future AI potential:
  - AI can consume requirements and design docs to propose a solution

## Skill #2 : Use Diagrams for Presentation

- Learn about common diagram forms
  - State transition Diagrams
  - Sequence Diagrams
- Use Diagramming as code

- What success looks like:
  - Documentation is easier to understand by your peers
  - Codified diagrams can be reviewed just like any code

- Future AI potential:
  - Diagrams can improve the fidelity of AI generated solutions

## Skill #3 : Perform frequent code reviews

- Review code from other people
- Learn to batch work to make for easier review
- Use conventional commits to convey code change meaning

- What success looks like:
  - You are able to perform more code reviews efficiently and frequently

- Future AI potential:
  - You will be able to spot quality issues from AI submitted solutions

## Skill #4 : Code in multiple languages

- Identify a solution that benefits from a different codebase 
- Use AI tool to train on another codebase

- What success looks like:
  - You are able to build solutions in multiple codebases
  - You can recognize patterns of logic behavior in multiple code languages

- Future AI potential:
  - You can review a larger variety of AI proposed solutions

## Skill #5 : Adopt Test Driven Development

- Train on the Write Test, Write Code, Refactor loop
- Use AI tools at each step

- What success looks like:
  - You gain the quality improvements that come with TDD
  - You train your brain on short-iterative development cycles with constant feedback loops.

- Future AI potential:
  - Your Tests can act as a prompt-engineering framework for building with AI

## Skill #6 : Create quality gates

- Create larger automation tests which test in larger scope
- Improve code throughput using trunk based development
- Capture manual process requirements as checkin criteria

- What success looks like:
  - Creates an outer-loop where more expensive testing can function in a TDD-like feedback system.
  - Code submitted into a main trunk branch and can be released to production using automation

- Future AI potential:
  - AI submitted code proposals can be fully automated

## Skill #7 : Use ring deployments

- Deploy code to a subset of users
- Measure for impact to users before proceeding to release to the rest of the user base

- What success looks like:
  - Deployment blast radius can be controlled
  - Confidence in quality is measured before deploying to larger sets of users

- Future AI potential:
  - Codebases with AI submitted solutions can be trained on meeting criteria before rolling forward

## Skill #8 : Use Feature Toggles

- Code new behavior of a feature behind a toggle
- Develop techniques to handle toggle complexity and lifecycle management

- What success looks like:
  - Code can be deployed independent of releasing a feature
  - Problems in features can be instantly reverted without needing additional deployments
- Future AI potential:
  - AI submitted solutions can be isolated and released in a controlled manner.

## Skill #9 : Develop a dashboard with alerts

- Identify metrics to measure behavior of new feature code
- Create a dashboard for your team that graphs the metric with a threshold for success and failure
- Alert the team when the metrics are in the failure state

- What success looks like:
  - Team understands how to leverage metrics for feature concerns
  - Dashboard can be expanded to include future use cases
  - Issues with features from customers are alerted to the team in real time

- Future AI potential:
  - Issues with AI submitted solutions are quickly acknowledged by the team
  - Team will be in a position to benefit from AI based automated alerts

## Skill #10 : Get involved in customer insight

- Discuss how analysis of client insights are gathered with your Product and Design team
- Identify an opportunity to provide additional analytics

- What success looks like:
  - User Experience gets access to data that allows them to understand customer behavior
  - Product has knowledge of new metrics that can help shape Product market fit

- Future AI potential:
  - Understanding insights closes the virtuous cycle that enables for more AI generated solutions to be leveraged
